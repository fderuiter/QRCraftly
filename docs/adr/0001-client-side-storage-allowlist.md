# Client-Side Generation and Storage Allowlist

## Context

QR code payloads frequently contain sensitive personal data, such as Wi-Fi passwords, contact cards, healthcare identifiers, and authentication tokens. Storing user payloads on remote servers or unencrypted in browser storage creates severe HIPAA/GDPR compliance liabilities.

## Decision

We execute all QR code generation, canvas rendering, and scannability evaluation strictly client-side in volatile browser memory. Persistent browser storage (`localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `IndexedDB`) is restricted to an explicit allowlist of non-sensitive preference keys verified by an AST build auditor (`scripts/storage_privacy_ast_auditor.js`).

## Rationale

Client-side execution eliminates data transit across external networks and ensures zero server-side data retention liability. An automated AST auditor prevents accidental persistence of user payloads during development.

## Consequences

- Zero backend database liability or exposure to transit intercept attacks for static QR codes.
- Batch or headless generation cannot be performed server-side without a client rendering context.
- Unapproved persistent storage keys fail the automated build pipeline closed.
